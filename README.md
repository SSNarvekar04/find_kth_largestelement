 Find Kth Largest Element in an Array (python)

This repository contains a Python implementation to find the k-th largest element in an unsorted array using the heap strategy from Pythonâ€™s 'heapq' module.

Problem Statement

Find Kth Largest Element in an Array 
Given an unsorted list and an integer k, find the k-th largest element in the list.

Note: The k-th largest element means the element that would appear in position 'k' if the list were sorted in descending order.
 Approach: Heap

We use a heap of size 'k'. As we iterate through the array:
- Push every number into the heap.
- If the heap size exceeds 'k', we remove the smallest element.
- After processing all elements, the smallest in the heap (heap[0]) is the k-th largest element.
